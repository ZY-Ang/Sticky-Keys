>>>>> GAME CONCEPT

	  Both of you are Shift-Keys trying to survive under a filthy programmer's grubby
	  fingers and his constant abuse. All the other keys have already fallen, and one
	  of you is next...
	  
	  Use your Shift! powers to swap positions with each other. Why? Because only one
	  of you can survive.
	  
	  Don't get hit by falling hazards, they will deduct your health and do bad stuff.
	  
	  Some fallen keys may give you little benefits to help you survive the programmer's
	  onslaught, while others may just hinder your survival out of spite and jealousy.
	  Try to figure out what each fallen key does!
	  
	  Lastly, if you get hit by the programmer's finger, then everything will be OVER.
	  
	  Have fun and good luck!
